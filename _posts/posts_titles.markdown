1. What's new in React v16.3 - This will focus on the new features of the recently released React.js library.

2. Learn RxJS (Reactive extensions for JavaScript) by building one - Here, I will build the RxJS library from scratch. It will be divided into two series, one will focus one RxJS operators and the other on RxJS observables. I will also code RXJS's Subject, BehaviorSubject, AsyncSubject, PublishSubject and ReplaySubject. I have built the library already. Here is the github link: https://github.com/philipszdavido/rxjs

3. Build your own Redux library: Here, I will clone the Redux library, explaining and coding the Redux APIs (createStore, getState, combineReducers). Here is the link of the project: https://github.com/philipszdavido/_redux.

4. Build TheMovieDB clone using Node.js and React.: I will create the clone of the popular movie site themoviedb.com using Node.js, Hapi.js, React Redux.

5. Deploy Angular component/module as an NPM module: I'll demonstrate how to publish an Angular module to NPM.

6. Deploy React component as an NPM module: I'll show how to write and publish a React component/library to NPM.

7. Build a SSR app with Preact: I'll explore how to build a server-rendered app using preact, preact-router and react-redux.

8. Lazy Loading in Angular: I'll demo here, how to load lazily Angular module, features module and components.

9. Beginner's Guide to ngrx and Angular: This will focus on introducing ngrx and its use in Angular.


Awesome. Initial feedback:

Defining MPA so late in the paragraph was confusing. I'm a developer and have never used that acronym so I think it makes sense to be more descriptive ahead of time.

I really don't think the MPA comparison lands right. I would probably remove it.

You listed the source code repo in the middle of the article which interrupts the flow. Let's move that down to the end.

Can you explain to the reader what they're going to install and link to it within the text? I see now why you added the section titled "Source Code" but it doesn't explain what it does and why a reader should install it. 
When scaffolding your the demo app, there's a lot of params being used but not detail on what they do. So in "ng g c home" what should the reader expect? You don't need to describe the same command twice but explaining parameters a first time helps readers better understand you.

I stopped reading because I noticed a similar pattern in the rest of the article. The key bit of feedback I can offer is that you need to be descriptive in a feature post. A reader will want to know not only the how but the why and I think your article currently lacks the latter.

I'm going to ask if you could please dig in deeper into this and add more context to what your code does.
